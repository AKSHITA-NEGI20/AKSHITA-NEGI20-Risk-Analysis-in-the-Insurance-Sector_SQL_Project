# Risk Analysis in the Insurance Sector-A Data Driven Approach

The insurance industry is a complex and dynamic sector that relies heavily on data-driven insights to make informed decisions about risk assessment and policy development. With the increasing complexity of modern life, the need for accurate and comprehensive risk assessments has become more pressing than ever. In this project, we aim to leverage the power of data analysis and visualization to identify high-risk customers and develop a risk scoring model that can be used to inform business decisions.

By analyzing a dataset of insurance customers, we will explore various factors that contribute to the risk profile of each individual, including demographic information, health metrics, and behavioral patterns. Our analysis will focus on identifying patterns and correlations that can help us develop a more accurate and effective risk assessment model. The ultimate goal of this project is to create a risk scoring model that can be used to identify high-risk customers and develop targeted marketing strategies to cater to their needs.

Through this project, we hope to demonstrate the value of data-driven insights in the insurance industry and provide a framework for other companies to follow. By leveraging the power of data analysis and visualization, we can create a more accurate and effective risk assessment model that benefits both the insurance company and its customers.
This data-driven approach provides insights into high-risk factors, helping insurance companies to make informed decisions and improve their risk management strategies. â€‹

# Download Insurance dataset from below link :
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teertha/ushealthinsurancedataset

Import the dataset in sql server with table name : Insurance_data

Change the column names to lower case before importing data to sql server.Also replace space within column names with underscore.

While importing make sure to change the data types of columns. by defualt it shows everything as varchar.

# Based on this dataset, the following types of analysis questions We'll be answering:

# Demographic Analysis
1.What is the distribution of age groups among the insured individuals?

2.How do gender and marital status affect the likelihood of insurance coverage?

# Health and Lifestyle Factors
3.What is the correlation between BMI (Body Mass Index) and health insurance claims?

4.How do smoking and drinking habits influence insurance claims?

# Insurance Coverage and Claims
5.What is the average cost of health insurance premiums by region?

6.How do different insurance plans (e.g., HMO, PPO) affect claim frequencies?

# Predictive Modeling
7.Can we predict the likelihood of health insurance claims based on demographic and health factors?

8.What are the key predictors of high claim frequencies?

# Customer Behavior and Retention
9.How do customer satisfaction ratings correlate with retention rates?

10.What are the most common reasons for policy cancellations?

# Market Trends and Competition
11.How do market trends (e.g., economic conditions, regulatory changes) affect insurance premiums and claim frequencies?

12.What are the key differentiators between competing insurance providers?

# These questions provide a framework for conducting detailed analysis on the US Health Insurance Dataset, enabling insights into various aspects of the insurance sector, from demographic trends to predictive modeling and market competition.
